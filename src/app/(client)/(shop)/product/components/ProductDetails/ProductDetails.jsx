                The patented eighteen-inch hardwood Arrowhead deck --- finely
                mortised in, makes this the strongest and most rigid canoe ever
                built. You cannot buy a canoe that will afford greater satisfaction.

                The St. Louis Meramec Canoe Company was founded by Alfred Wickett in
                1922. Wickett had previously worked for the Old Town Canoe Co from
                1900 to 1914. Manufacturing of the classic wooden canoes in Valley
                Park, Missouri ceased in 1978.
